\title{Organelle markers}
\usage{
pRolocmarkers(species)
}
\arguments{
\item{species}{The species of interest.}
}
\value{
Prints a description of the available marker lists if
\code{species} is missing or a named character with organelle
markers.
}
\description{
This function retrieves a list of organelle markers or, if no
\code{species} is provided, prints a description of available
marker sets. The markers can be added to and \code{MSnSet} using
the \code{\link{addMarkers}} function.
}
\details{
The markers have been contributed by various members of the
Cambridge Centre for Proteomics, in particular Dan Nightingale for
yeast, Dr Andy Christoforou for human, Dr Arnoud Groen for
Arabodopsis and Dr Claire Mulvey for mouse.  In addition, original
(curated) markers from the \code{pRolocdata} datasets have been
extracted (see \code{pRolocdata} for details and references).
Curation involved verification of publicly available subcellular
localisation annotation based on the curators knowledge of the
organelles/proteins considered and tracing the original statement
in the literature.

These markers are provided as a starting point to generate
reliable sets of organelle markers but still need to be verified
against any new data in the light of the quantitative data and the
study conditions.
